VLSI設計自動化導論的課程作業  

Given a graph as shown below. The number in parentheses on each edge is the weight of the edge.  
The graph is also described in a file with MCNC benchmark format. Please write a program to   
(a) Apply DFS(depth first search) algorithm to print out the traverse order of vertices   
(b) Apply single source shortest path(Dijkstra) algorithm to print out the distance from source to every vertex.
